# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

    *Very confident! Not many to memorize.*

2. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

*Fairly confident! I just did a quick search of the third logical operator that we haven't learned yet - don't quite get it yet.*

3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

*I would say a little confident because I still don't feel fluent in knowing the order or operations to set up the else if/ else statements.*

4. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

*About 2-3 hours on and off. About what I expected.*


5. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

*I'd like to spend more time practicing more complex if statement problems. I will continue on to the next lessons and return to practice if I can make time before next session*


6. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

*No outstanding questions at this time.*
